<article>I miss you already. So I thought I should write a letter to you on this International Friendhsip Day, 30th July 2020. Thanks for being my friend since my childhood. I have got many sweet memories with you.You are the one who knows everything good and bad about me. The time I spent with you during our schooldays was amazing. There are many unforgettable moments with you. You have never left my side at any situation.I am Sorry for everything I did. I want you to be with me till the end like a great friend, a well wisher and a sister. No matter what happened and what happens, please dont leave me and dont let me go. Yes, I agree that I am not talking regularly with you on phone and I am not chatting with you on Whatsapp daily, but I wont forget to remember you every single day.<b>Be with me forever.</b> I hope you will...I may not be the best "best friend" of you, but you will be the best best best friend of me.  You are my best friend always. I love you. I really love you so much...
